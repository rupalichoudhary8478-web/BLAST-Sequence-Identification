# BLAST-Sequence-Identification
Identification and functional annotation of unknown DNA and protein sequences using NCBI BLAST and comparative sequence analysis.

Activity 2: Identification of Unknown Biological Sequences Using BLAST
Objective
The objective of this activity is to identify unknown biological sequences using the NCBI BLAST tool and determine:

The type of sequence (DNA or protein)
The organism to which the sequence belongs
The biological significance of the sequence
Interpretation of BLAST output parameters such as percentage identity and E-value
Tool Used
NCBI BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)
Website: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Methodology
The given unknown sequences were analyzed to determine whether they were nucleotide or protein sequences.
Appropriate BLAST programs were selected:
BLASTn for DNA sequences
BLASTp for protein sequences
Sequences were pasted into the BLAST query box using default parameters.
The top BLAST hits were analyzed based on:
Organism
Percentage identity
Query coverage
E-value
Results were interpreted to identify the biological role of each sequence.
Sequence Analysis and Results
Sequence 1
Sequence Type: DNA
BLAST Program Used: BLASTn
Query Length: 220 bp
Top Hit
Identified As: Zaire ebolavirus genome segment
Organism: Zaire ebolavirus
Percent Identity: 100%
Query Coverage: 100%
E-value: 4e-109
Interpretation
The extremely low E-value and complete identity indicate a highly significant match. The sequence perfectly aligns with the Ebola virus genome.

Biological Function
This sequence forms part of the Ebola virus genome, which encodes proteins essential for viral replication and pathogenicity.

Sequence 2
Sequence Type: DNA
BLAST Program Used: BLASTn
Query Length: 240 bp
Top Hit
Identified As: Human insulin (INS) gene
Organism: Homo sapiens
Percent Identity: 100%
Query Coverage: 100%
E-value: 4e-120
Interpretation
The perfect match confirms that the sequence belongs to the human insulin gene, a key gene involved in metabolic regulation.

Biological Function
The insulin gene regulates blood glucose levels and plays a crucial role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

Sequence 3
Sequence Type: Protein
BLAST Program Used: BLASTp
Query Length: 100 amino acids
Top Hit
Identified As: Envelope glycoprotein gp160
Organism: Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1)
Percent Identity: ~80–89%
Query Coverage: ~92%
E-value: 2e-44
Interpretation
The low E-value and high identity indicate a strong similarity, confirming that the sequence corresponds to an HIV envelope protein.

Biological Function
The gp160 protein is involved in viral attachment and entry into host cells and is essential for HIV infectivity.

Summary Table
Sequence	Type	Organism	Category
Seq 1	DNA	Zaire ebolavirus	Viral genome
Seq 2	DNA	Homo sapiens	Human gene
Seq 3	Protein	HIV-1	Viral protein
Conclusion
All unknown biological sequences were successfully identified using the NCBI BLAST tool. Sequence 1 was identified as a genomic fragment of Zaire ebolavirus, Sequence 2 as the human insulin gene, and Sequence 3 as the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BLAST in identifying and characterizing biological sequences.
